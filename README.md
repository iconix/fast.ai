# fast.ai

My work for fast.ai's [Deep Learning for Coders (2017)](https://github.com/fastai/courses/tree/master/deeplearning1)

See the [help content](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/README.md) if interested in my personal course notes.

I blogged about taking this course as well:
- [_fast.ai, week 2_](https://iconix.github.io/notes/2017/08/18/fast-week2.html)
- [_fast.ai in review_](https://iconix.github.io/notes/2018/03/25/fast-ai-in-review.html)
