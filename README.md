# fast.ai

My work for fast.ai's [Deep Learning for Coders (2017)](https://github.com/fastai/courses/tree/master/deeplearning1)

If interested in my personal course notes, please see the [help](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/README.md) section.

I blogged about taking this course as well:

- [_fast.ai in review_ **TODO:** link]()
