1. [lesson0](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/lesson0.md) - a high-level overview of deep learning; then a very rapid introduction to the convolution operation and stochastic gradient descent.
2. [lesson1](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/lesson1.md) - tips on how to approach this course and deep learning in general (no specific notes on _cats vs. dogs_ competition)
3. [lesson2](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/lesson2.md) - understanding the finetuning and fitting processes; plus, notes on CS231n's technical introduction to CNNs (including SGD optimization, intuitions for backpropagation, and setting up neural network architectures
