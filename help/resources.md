# Recurring Resources
_Things Jeremy found cool enough to bring up multiple times in class._

1. [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf) by Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus
    - [Deep Visualization Toolbox](http://yosinski.com/deepvis#toolbox)
3. [A visual proof that neural nets can compute any function](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) by Michael Nealson
    - Part of the free, online [_Neural Networks and Deep Learning_](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) book that is highly cited throughout this course
4. [Image Kernels: Explained Visually](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
5. Excellent technical writing on [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/) by Stanford CS231n
    - Notes on these CNN pages included at the bottom of my [lesson 2 notes](https://github.com/iconix/fast.ai/blob/master/help/2017/lesson2.md)
